                    <p>If you’ve ever skipped breakfast after rolling out of bed too late…if you’ve ever missed a lunch because of a busy schedule…if you’ve ever had a guilty conscience over a midnight microwave burrito… Soylent is made for you.</p>
                    <p> Protein, carbohydrates, lipids, and micronutrients: each Soylent product contains a complete blend of everything the body needs to thrive. It turns a full meal into a one-step process. It makes things a lot less complicated. And when you’re busy, it takes eating off your plate.</p>
                    <p>Soylent is committed to providing positive nutrition in the United States and around the world. In 2016, we donated over one million meals to those in need. We continue to donate to partner organizations like the World Food Program's Innovation Accelerator and food banks across the country. And we work with physicians as we develop new products to increase access to complete nutrition.</p>
                    <p>Food wastes more than just our time. Because all Soylent drinks are made from plants, they require less water and produce less CO2 than livestock. Our drinks also reduce food waste with a year-long shelf life and don’t require refrigeration, unlike fruits and vegetables that get tossed after a few days or weeks in the fridge.</p>

                            <p>Soylent Nectar is a flavor pretty much exclusive to South Louisiana. Though most would figure something with the name nectar to taste like a tropical fruit, nectar syrup is a neon-pink concoction that is overflowing with almond and vanilla flavoring.</p>

                            <p>Soylent Cacao tastes like a weak hot chocolate or perhaps chocolate flavored almond milk. It doesn’t quite qualify as dessert, but it is a lot closer than original Soylent 2.0. I’ve seen a few commenters online mention that they can’t handle the taste of Soylent alone so they frequently mix it with chocolate power or Nesquick. If this is you, you’ll probably love (or at least like) Cacao.</p>

                <p>Soylent™ is a leading pioneer in food technology, producing good healthy, functional foods that are good for the body and the planet. In 2013, Founder and CEO Rob Rhinehart developed the first iteration in his kitchen after recognizing the need for a simpler, more efficient food source. Soylent uses science and technology to solve the challenges plaguing the current food system and work toward its mission of providing access to quality nutrition to people across the globe.</p>

                <img src="images/about-2.jpg" alt="about soylent" id="about-2">
                <p>The co-founders of Soylent met while working on a pair of startups under the same roof in Sunnyvale, CA. Living off a diet of frozen food and ramen, they grew frustrated with the experience. Now, we seek to use science, tech, and enterprise as tools to help make eating easier. We aim to create a portfolio of products that make eating an easier part of your day. We hope to expand access to quality nutrition through food system innovation.</p>
